# Rebar 2.0

### About 2.0

---

Rebar 2.0 is a complete recoding of Rebar from the bottom up. The goal of Rebar 2.0 is to create
a cleaner, more reliable, well-organized, and properly documented library and continue where Rebar
1.0 left off.

Emphasis will be placed on code style, readability, documentation, and proper, stable code.

Other than that, little will change with the overt functionality of Rebar. The API will be easier
to use (especially string operations), and much will be organized better, but the actual design and
goals of the language will remain fairly stable.

I have learned many things when building Rebar 1.0 (in addition to the numerous preceding attempts
to build Rebar, of which there are too many to count), and I want to build it again the right way.

I want to build something of which I am proud.


*These are my motivations for doing a complete rebuild of Rebar. If you're interested in details
on the actual language itself, I will be adding documentation soon. For now, you can get an
overview at the old repository [here](https://github.com/Buckell/rebar).*
